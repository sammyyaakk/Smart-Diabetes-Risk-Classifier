# Smart Diabetes Risk Classifier

This project is a machine learning-based classifier that predicts the risk of diabetes based on various health-related inputs. It is designed for preliminary evaluation, not diagnostic decision-making.
It is built using Python and Jupyter Notebook, and utilizes classification algorithms to analyze patterns in health data.

## Features

- Predicts diabetes risk using clinical data
- Trained on datasets with features like glucose, BMI, age, etc.
- Includes data visualization and preprocessing steps
- Compares multiple models for performance
- Built entirely in a Jupyter Notebook
